            <!--paragraph about me-->
            <p>I am a Full Stack Web Developer, specializing in ReactJS, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, having completed training at the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp. Along with the many projects completed there, I created a live-updating search feature for a television tracking app, employing ReactJS and RESTful APIs. I enjoy taking on these challenges as they allow me to flex the same skills that I used while solving puzzles as a kid and while earning a BA in Mathematics at Vassar College. Iâ€™ve balanced multiple jobs or roles at every point in my life, which have developed my task management and organizational skills. Having taken on leadership roles in college and currently as a high school choir director, I am comfortable guiding and instructing a group while also listening to feedback and implementing appropriate changes.</p>
