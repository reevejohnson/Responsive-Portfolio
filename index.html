            <!--paragraph about me-->
            <p>I am a Full Stack Web Developer looking to become a part of a group of programmers who assist nonprofits and organizations in building websites or apps. Iâ€™ve balanced multiple jobs or roles at any point in my life, which has developed my task management and organizational skills. I enjoy pseudocoding and basic coding languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which build off the skills I've devloped from when I was solving puzzles as a kid to when I earned a BA in Mathematics at Vassar College. Having taken on leadership roles in college and currently as a high school choir director, I am comfortable guiding and instructing a group while also listening to feedback and implementing appropriate changes.</p>
